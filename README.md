# Hello_Seattle
Welcome to one of my Udacity projects where the point is to examine a data set as well as create a blog post about it.  My blog post can be found here (https://tbdatasci.wordpress.com/2019/04/17/hello_seattle/), and it's purposefully very non-technical.  This GitHub repository holds the both the raw data and my Python notebook analyzing the raw data found here (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).

In short, I find that Airbnb prices in Seattle rise during the summer and fall during the winter.  Additionally, Superhosts are more likely to respond quickly to inquiries, verify their identities, and not allow flexible cancellation policies than their typical host counterparts.  Lastly, the median earnings for an Airbnb location in Seattle is $11,700.
