# Hello_Seattle
This is just an over-arching look at Seattle Airbnb data.  Basically, I examine seasonality within the Seattle Airbnb market, what actions Superhosts take that typical hosts don't, and the expected amount a host can earn per year on Airbnb.

The data can be found on Kaggle's webpage here (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).
